# LBPD crime data

The "LBPD" mobile app available for both iOS and Android is developed by [MobilePD](http://gomobilepd.com/). Previous projects by several local developers sought to access the same data GoMobilePD uses - initial analysis showed that the data used by this app could be accessed as a XML-based API at the following uri: <http://api.ezaxess.com/v2/pd/longbeach/crimes/all>

This data feed - and the LBPD mobile apps - no longer appears to be functional. The HackLB DLF would love to find another source for this data - ideally, directly from the city - as crime data is of deep interest to many city stakeholders.
