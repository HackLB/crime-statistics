# LBPD crime data

The "LBPD" mobile app available for both iOS and Android is developed by [MobilePD](http://gomobilepd.com/). Previous projects by several local developers sought to access the same data GoMobilePD uses - initial analysis showed that the data used by this app could be accessed as a XML-based API at the following uri: <http://api.ezaxess.com/v2/pd/longbeach/crimes/all>

This data feed is frequently unavailable, often for weeks at a time, and only represents recent crime activity, providing no access to historical data. This repository seeks to serve as a both a cache of the most recent records, as well as a permanent archive of historical data. The HackLB DLF would love to find another source for this data - ideally, directly from the city - as crime data is of deep interest to many city stakeholders.
